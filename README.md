## What is docker?

- Docker is a container management tool.
- Enables users to create, deploy and run applications using containers.

> Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and deploy it as one package. By doing so, thanks to the container, the developer can rest assured that the application will run on any other Linux machine regardless of any customized settings that machine might have that could differ from the machine used for writing and testing the code.

## What is a container?

- A standardized unit of software.

A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.

Container images become containers at runtime and in the case of Docker containers - images become containers when they run on Docker Engine. Available for both Linux and Windows-based applications, containerized software will always run the same, regardless of the infrastructure. Containers isolate software from its environment and ensure that it works uniformly despite differences for instance between development and staging.

### Docker containers that run on Docker Engine:

- **Standard**: Docker created the industry standard for containers, so they could be portable anywhere
- **Lightweight**: Containers share the machineâ€™s OS system kernel and therefore do not require an OS per application, driving higher server efficiencies and reducing server and licensing costs
- **Secure**: Applications are safer in containers and Docker provides the strongest default isolation capabilities in the industry

| Containers are an abstraction at the app layer that packages code and dependencies together. Multiple containers can run on the same machine and share the OS kernel with other containers, each running as isolated processes in user space. Containers take up less space than VMs (container images are typically tens of MBs in size), can handle more applications and require fewer VMs and Operating systems. | Virtual machines (VMs) are an abstraction of physical hardware turning one server into many servers. The hypervisor allows multiple VMs to run on a single machine. Each VM includes a full copy of an operating system, the application, necessary binaries and libraries - taking up tens of GBs. VMs can also be slow to boot. |

## What docker does

- Carves up a computer into sealed container that runs a code
- Gets the code to adn fro from a computer.
- Docker builds containers.
- Docker has a social platform to find and share containers which are different from virtual machines.

## Installing docker on a windows machine
- Search for docker desktop and install it from exe
- We need a docker id to download docker desktop so create one.
- It might as to use windows containers instead of linux, do not check that. Linux containers will be light weight.
- Once installed to check if docker is running properly, see if the whale symbol is showing up in system tray if yes go to terminal and type command ``` docker info ```, it will provide bunch of information about docker.
- To run a container locally use command ``` docker run container-name ``` like ``` docker run hello-world ```
- This will check if we have docker image locally if not it wil pull from docker hub and then run in.
